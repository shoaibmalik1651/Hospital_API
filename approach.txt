HOSPITAL-API


we are going to design an API for the doctors of a Hospital which has been
allocated by the govt for testing and quarantine + well being of COVID-19
patients

-There can be 2 types of Users
-Doctors
-Patients


-Doctors can log In
-Each time a patient visits, the doctor will follow 2 steps
-Register the patient in the app(using phone number , if the patient 
already exists, just return the the patient info in the API)
-

-Routes in Hospital-API

- /doctors/register → with username and password
- /doctors/login → returns the JWT to be used
- /patients/register
- /patients/:id/create_report
- /patients/:id/all_reports → List all the reports of a patient oldest to latest
- /reports/:status → List all the reports of all the patients filtered by a specific status

- Decide the fields and schemas on your own, smartly
- Decide which routes need to be protected by authentication
